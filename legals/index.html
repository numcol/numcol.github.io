        <p class="answer">
          Our apps contain third-party advertising. We may occasionally promote other products of our own within our
          apps.
          We may occasionally cross-promote the products of other affiliated developers that offer similar products and
          share
          similar values as expressed on their own published privacy policies.
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          Numcol contains advertising served through the AdMob platform that it is a platform with the ability to
          activate
          <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6223431?hl=en">a flag to only serve ads Designed for
            Families</a>.
